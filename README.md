A Deep Neural Network as Variational Ansatz for finding Many-Body ground states (implemented for my master thesis)

This work was inspired by Carleo's [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02318.pdf "Solving the Quantum Many-Body Problem with Artificial Neural Networks"), and implements a similar approach for training a neural network to find the ground state of a fermionic many-body system.
